#
# Configurations for Gwall.
#
# First you have to set which program you want to use, I've
# tested this script with feh and gconftool-2, to set the
# background with feh use the following combination:
#   PROG="feh"
#   ARGS="--bg-fill"
# If you would like to use gconftool-2 which is used by
# Gnome desktop, use the following combination:
#   PROG="gconftool-2"
#   ARGS="-s /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename -t string --"
#
# Next you should set the time to wait before actually rotating
# the background(ROTATE_SLEEP), this time is defined in seconds
# and will be passed to sleep(1), you can disable the rotating
# feature by setting ROTATE to 'false'...
#
# Last but not least you should add wallpaper folders to the
# FOLDERS array which we will take the wallpapers from, remember
# that it is an array so it should look like this example:
#
#   FOLDERS=(
#      ${HOME}/Pictures/Wallpapers/1024x768
#      ${HOME}/Pictures/Wallpapers/1280x1024
#      ${HOME}/Pictures/Wallpapers/1280x800
#      ${HOME}/Pictures/Wallpapers/1600x1200
#      ${HOME}/Pictures/Wallpapers/800x600
#      ${HOME}/Pictures/Wallpapers/Other
#       )
#
# You can disable the image randomizer by setting DISABLE
# to true, this will disable looking for any wallpaper, and
# actually will use the image you have used before (or
# define by yourself). NOTE: this currently works with feh
# and gconftool-2 only, so don't bother setting it to false
# if you use another program.
#

# Disable Gwall and use whatever is pre-defined?
DISABLE="false"

# Program to use to set the background
PROG="feh"

# Program parameters
ARGS="--bg-scale"

# Rotate ??
ROTATE="true"

# Sleep for how long while rotating?? (in seconds)
ROTATE_SLEEP="900"

# Folders array
