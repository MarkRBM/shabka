#   Construct a crontab based on files in ~/.cron and load it into cron.
#   The file ~/.cron/username/fqdn is appended to the common file in the same
#   directory. Note that the common file may have "$HOME" in it, as in
#   "PATH=$HOME/bin". cron is too dumb to deal with that, so the expansion is
#   handled by this script.
